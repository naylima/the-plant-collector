# Easily manage your packages with npm link.

## Why?

As for me, i use gulp and some gulp plugins in my project. Every time when i start a new project, i have to install them
again even though i have installed in global. I can use `npm link`, but it can't save
packages to package.json. So I make this tool to manage it.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install nlt -g
```
---
## Usage

```bash
$ nlt install
```
Same efficacy as npm install

```bash
$ nlt install <package> [--save || --save-dev]
```

```bash
$ nlt uninstall <package> [--save || --save-dev]
```
